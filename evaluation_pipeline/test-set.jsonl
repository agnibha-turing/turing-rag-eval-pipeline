We're laser-focused on execution, and what you've seen is just the\nstart of a transformative period for GM. We are strategically building an EV portfolio\nin the luxury, SUV, and truck segments to produce vehicles with great design at the\nright price points for customers and at the margins we come to expect.\nThis concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of\nthe call.\n\nDocument 12168: The work is helping us meet our $2 billion �xed cost reduction program this year and\nthe savings will be even greater in the future.
